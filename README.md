#Unveiling the Insights: An In-Depth Power BI & SQL Project on Pizza Sales#



In this comprehensive data-driven endeavor, I take you on a detailed exploration of pizza sales using the powerful combination of Power BI and SQL. 
From data extraction to creating impactful visualizations, join me as I reveal valuable insights that can significantly impact your pizza business strategy.

Step 1: Data Acquisition
The journey begins with accessing the SQL Server database and extracting data from the "pizza_sales" table. This raw dataset serves as the cornerstone of my analysis.

Step 2: Total Revenue Analysis
To gauge the success of pizza sales, I employ a SQL query along with the "concat" function to calculate the total revenue generated. The result is elegantly displayed in a currency format.

Step 3: Average Order Value Examination
To gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior, I analyze the average order value. By dividing the total revenue with the number of distinct orders,
I derive valuable insights into the monetary value of each order.

Step 4: Total Pizzas Sold Evaluation
Delving further into the data, I aggregate the quantity of pizzas sold to determine the overall number of pizzas delighting pizza enthusiasts.

Step 5: Average Pizzas Per Order Assessment
The popularity of pizza orders beckons me to compute the average number of pizzas per order. By dividing the total pizzas sold by the number of distinct orders, I uncover the typical order size.

Step 6: Daily and Monthly Trend Analysis
Visualizing daily and monthly pizza orders allows me to discern patterns and fluctuations over time, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of sales trends.

Step 7: % of Sales by Pizza Category
To explore the distribution of sales across different pizza categories, I leverage SQL queries to generate pie charts and bar graphs.
These visualizations highlight customer preferences for various pizza types.

Step 8: Top and Bottom Performer Identification
Through SQL queries, I identify the top and bottom-performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders. 
This analysis yields essential insights into pizza sales performance.

Step 9: Leveraging Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
To augment the analysis, I harness the power of DAX in Power BI. Creating measures such as "AvgOrderValue," "AvgPizzasPerOrder," "TotalOrders," "TotalPizzasSold," 
and "TotalRevenue" enhances the analysis and enriches the visualizations.

Step 10: Captivating Data Visualization
The final report is brought to life with an array of compelling visualizations, including slicers, cards, column charts, pie charts, area charts, 
and navigation buttons. These visuals effectively present the valuable insights derived from the data.


As I conclude this data-driven journey through pizza sales, I aim to inspire you to embark on your own insightful data exploration. 
The combined capabilities of Power BI and SQL offer a robust toolkit to uncover valuable business insights.
